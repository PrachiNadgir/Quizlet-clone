# Quizlet Clone
# Author: Prachi Nadgir

This is a frontend-only clone of the Quizlet platform, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It recreates the basic look and functionality of Quizlet’s flashcard feature for learning and practice purposes.

📌 About the Project
The goal of this project was to explore and improve my frontend development skills by replicating a real-world web application's interface. While the core features are implemented, this version is currently not responsive and is best viewed on desktop screens.

✨ Features
Static interface to create and view flashcards

Flip animation to switch between question and answer

Simple UI inspired by Quizlet

🚧 Limitations
Not responsive for mobile or tablet devices

No backend functionality (data is not saved permanently)

🙏 Special Thanks
A heartfelt thank you to Quizlet for being a powerful learning tool and a source of inspiration. This project is a tribute to the amazing platform that has helped so many students succeed. It was created purely for educational purposes.
